## How  did the semester go?

Overall I'd say it was decent. From a technical standpoint I believe I have shown that I have the knowledge to pass this semester. From a Professional and Process viewpoint this is less solid but I believe still good enough. In the GP I did really well in those parts but the IP fell behind due to a lack of motivation and some mental health issues. I tried catching up at the end but there just wasn't enough time to get everything up to what I would have liked it to be. Still, I believe it should be enough to pass the semester.

## What could I have done better?
1. Work ethic and motivation: See above
2. Approaching the project: I approached the project from a very "waterfal" angle - the first (and only) part I implemented was the account system. This provides no business value to the "customer" if in isolation and I should have started by working on actual core functionality - the goals of the application - instead of on something to support that.
3. User Experience was way too low a priority. I barely did anything for it - some designs but no research or testing - and it shows in both of the projects. For future projects I will put more focus on getting user feedback early and in varied ways.
