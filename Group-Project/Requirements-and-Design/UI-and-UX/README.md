## UI and UX design
For the UI/UX I designed the original set of sketches based on discussion within the project group. I then turned these into rough wire-frames. See these [below](#wire-frames-and-sketches).

## UX Research
UX Research is one the weaknesses of our project. We should have started the project by using different research methods to design UX that is intuitive and compliant with not only the client's wishes but also that of potential end-users. We did not do this and thus we are left with testing at the end.

### Guerilla Testing

For UX testing I will conduct a simple guerilla test with the following scenarios for participants:

1. You arrive at the restaurant and would like to order two burgers and a coke.
2. While eating you get thirsty and decide to order another coke.
3. You're done eating. You want to check what you ordered and pay for it.

**Participant 1:**

1. On the Menu page changes the number of burgers and cokes to 2 each. Doesn't press Update and goes to the order overview page which has nothing on it. Gets slightly confused and goes to current orders - which also has nothing. Asks for help and I explain they have to press the Update button after setting how many of a product they want. They do that and figure out to go to the current order tab where they find the Order button after looking for a bit.
2. This goes fine although there's still some confusion between current orders and order overview.
3. Goes to order overview and presses pay. They had seen this option when doing 1/2

Conclusions:
1. The flow for adding products to the current order isn't clear. Having to press a button after changing the amount isn't intuitive - either change wording or remove button and have it automatically set the value it's set to. Wording for the tabs isn't clear. Current order is too similar to the menu. This makes it unclear what the difference is and makes finding the Order button difficult.
2. No new info, reaffirms that current layout/wording isn't intuitive.
3. No new info.
