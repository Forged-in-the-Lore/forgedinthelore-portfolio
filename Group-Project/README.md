# The Group project
Under this folder you will find documentation about the different learning goals for the group project of Semester 3. The structure is roughly the same as the learning outcomes on Canvas.
1. [Agile](Agile/README.md) describes how we used elements of Scrum throughout our project.
2. [Culture](Cultural-Differences/README.md) is a short piece on my personal experiences with cultural differences.
3. [Ethics](Ethics/README.md) contains an ethical analysis of our project based on the TICS Canvas framework.
4. [Professional](Professional/README.md) is about the role I played in the team and our professional conduct. It also contains a link to the research I did for my individual project.
5. [Requirements and Design](Requireents-and-Design/README.md) is about the all the product specific steps from before implementation.
6. [Web Application](Web-Application/README.md) is about the work I did when implementing the project with some interesting bits that I made.

Finally there is a [Retrospective](../Reflection/README.md) in which I reflect on this semester's work and how I can improve it.
