# Ethics

There are many different aspects of software engineering where ethical questions are relevant. Some concerns are valid for all fields: Don't be prejudiced, treat others well, take responsibility, don't promise what you can't deliver, etc. The interesting aspects of ethics in SE are the ones that are more specific to SE. Software is everywhere and in everything - from the text editor I'm writing this in to government registers or the control system of a car. Software can do a lot of good - or a lot of bad, depending on how it's made and used. This leads to a large responsibility for those who create software: we have to make sure that what we make works - because failing to work can lead to significant consequences -, and that it works in a way that isn't open to abuse. Sometimes you might even have to ask yourself if a project is at all acceptable to work on.

But all software isn't equal. A website where people can upload pictures of funny cats can be down for an hour without significant moral consequences - revenue might be lost, which is still important, but that's about it. The control system of a car can't fail, not even for a second, because if it does it could threaten the lives of those in or around the car. If that same website leaks personal data - say the username and email of everybody - it's bad, but it would be way worse if it also included all their users' home address and phone number. And why would a site like that even need that information?

There are many more parts to creating ethically sound software - take the [ACM Software Engineering Code of Ethics](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code/) -, but these examples demonstrate a very important aspect of ethical software engineering: Analysis. When designing software one should consider what the software does, how it does it and what that means for both the product and the process of creating it. If failure is a massive risk testing must be one of the most important parts of the creation process. Do we really need the personal data we store? Is there a safer alternative to storing it ourselves? Important is that we must not only perform an analysis, but draw conclusions from that with which we can improve our software.

To demonstrate such an analysis see the TICT analysis below.
