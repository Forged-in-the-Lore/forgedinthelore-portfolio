## Professionalism

### Team role
For this project I took on the role of team-leader, making sure our group stayed on course and guiding our process. In this role I did the following:
1. Guide the group in setting up our agreements about cooperation and work methods.
2. Lead meetings (and in the first sprint daily stand-ups) such as our sprint planning and retrospectives.
3. Organize to group to work on different parts of the project from documentation and design to implementation.
4. Try to provide guidance to the group on how to learn and achieve our goals this semester.

I also ended up taking some sort of senior-engineer role in guiding the rest of the team from a technical standpoint and providing help to other were needed.

### Communication with the client
As stated in our project plan I also took it upon myself to be responsible for communication with InfoSupport. This was mostly done by mail and mainly consisted of setting dates for meetings and sending them documentation.

### Stakeholder feedback
This is one of the weaker parts of our project. Although we actively sought feedback in the sprint reviews and tried to make as much use of that as possible we did a bad job of gathering feedback from other stakeholders such as potential end-users. We also made too many assumptions when designing our software that should have been based on stakeholder input or at the very least adjusted based on feedback before we implemented anything.

### Project Plan
In the [Project Plan](Project_Plan_Foodies.pdf) we specified the goal of the project, it's scope and the way we would be working. I am not certain which parts I wrote at the start of the semester except for the  architecture diagram and the chapter "Technische keuzes". As often with such projects we stuck to some of our initial plans - we did work with Scrum throughout the semester (see the learning outcome Agile) and our [Project Breakdown Structure](../Requirements-and-Design/Project-Breakdown-Structure/README.md) are still true (although we vastly overestimated how much we would get done) - but the initial plan for testing was almost entirely ignored when working on the project.
