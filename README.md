# Portfolio Semester 3

*David Hellinga - Spring 2022*

In this GitHub I will be documenting my work in semester 3. This will be split into two projects:

  1. [Forged in the Lore](Forged-in-the-Lore/README.md) - my individual project for IPS3
  2. [Group Project](Group-Project/README.md) - The Foodies project we did for InfoSupport

In addition to these there's the [Reflection](Reflection/README.md) chapter in which I - you'd never guess this - reflect on the semester and how it went.
