Forged in the Lore is a web-application for tracking and managing setting and campaign information with a focus on Tabletop RPGs such as Blades in the Dark. It is intended as my individual project for semester 3 at Fontys HBO-ICT.

## Content
This repository is split into three folders:
1. [Design](/Design/README.md) in which I will be detailing the concept and design - including architecture and reasoning for design choices.
2. [Web-Application](/Web-Application/README.md) is about the work I did to implement the designs while highlighting some interesting bits that I made. This section will also include some UX/UI related material.
3. [Software Quality](/Software-Quality/README.md) is about the different types of tests and testing methods I applied and why I chose those.
4. [CI/CD](/CI-CD/README.md) is about the continuous integration and delivery/deployment pipeline, it's stages and the choices that were made there there
5. [Research](/Research/README.md) in which any in-depth research I did for this project can be found.

Finally there is a [Reflection](/Reflection/README.md) in which I take a look at what I did - and how I did it - this semester, and what improvements to take from this.

Testen:
- Mini-onderzoekje: Wanneer UT, wanneer IT. Welke delen van de app zijn belangrijk en hoe moeten die getest worden? Wegens tijdsgebrek sommige dingen niet. Geef structuur aan keuzen
