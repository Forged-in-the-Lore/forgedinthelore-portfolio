# Concept
Forged in the Lore will be a webapp for tabletop RPGs with a focus on Blades in the Dark and Legends of the Wulin. It will allow Storytellers to track factions, characters or any other type of entity, the information about those things and the relations between them.
Storytellers will be able to create entity types, set what properties an entity has and define relationships. They will be able to control what players can see and give players the option to "buy" information via a "Lore Point" purchasing system. The players will only be able to see information that the ST has made available or that the player has bought.

This will be realized using a graph database - Neo4j - to store the information, which allows much more flexibility in defining relationships and entities. Users will have access to a set of preset entities and relationships with a limited pool of custom ones. A relational database will be used for user and campaign management.
