# Research

For this project I did two major researches:
1. A research about graph databases and whether they are a suitable solution for the storage of settings and campaigns: [Graph Databases](Graph-Databases.pdf)
2. A research on how to authenticate users if we have multiple services - and specifically how to do that in this project: [JWT Authentication with Multiple Services](JWT-Authentication-with-Multiple-Services.pdf) - NOTE: This does not go over OAuth since we are already using our own account system.
